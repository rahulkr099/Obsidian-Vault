Great Rahul! Here is a **simple, beginner-friendly API Design Course Plan** made specially for you.  
Follow this plan step-by-step, and you’ll start designing APIs like a real backend engineer in a very short time.

I’m keeping everything clear, practical, and easy to follow — no heavy theory.

---

# ⭐ **API Design Course Plan (Beginner → Intermediate)**

**Duration:** 14 Days (Just 1–2 hours per day)  
**Goal:** Learn how to design clean, scalable, production-style APIs.

---

# ⭐ **DAY 1 – What is an API?**

- What backend and frontend exchange
    
- REST API vs GraphQL (just basic idea)
    
- HTTP basics (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
    
- What is a status code (200, 201, 404, 500)
    

**Mini Task:**  
Explain to yourself what `/users/123` means.

---

# ⭐ **DAY 2 – URL Design (Routing Structure)**

Learn:

- Nouns for resources
    
- Using plural forms
    
- Meaningful route names (`/users`, `/tasks`, `/orders`)
    

**Mini Task:**  
Design URLs for a Todo App:

- create todo
    
- list todos
    
- update todo
    
- delete todo
    

---

# ⭐ **DAY 3 – HTTP Methods (Correct Usage)**

Practice:

- POST → create
    
- GET → read
    
- PUT/PATCH → update
    
- DELETE → remove
    

**Mini Task:**  
Write correct methods for:

- login
    
- logout
    
- add item to cart
    
- update password
    

---

# ⭐ **DAY 4 – Request Body + Params + Query**

Learn:

- When to use body (POST/PUT)
    
- When to use params (`:id`)
    
- When to use query (`?page=1&limit=10`)
    

**Mini Task:**  
Design a route for searching products by name with pagination.

---

# ⭐ **DAY 5 – Response Structure**

Learn:

- `success` field
    
- `message` field
    
- `data` field
    
- Consistent JSON format
    

**Mini Task:**  
Write a clean JSON response for:

```
GET /profile
```

---

# ⭐ **DAY 6 – Error Responses**

Learn:

- What is 400 (bad request)
    
- What is 401 (unauthorized)
    
- What is 404 (not found)
    
- What is 500 (server error)
    

**Mini Task:**  
Write an error JSON for wrong login.

---

# ⭐ **DAY 7 – Authentication (JWT Basics)**

Learn:

- Access token
    
- Bearer token
    
- How token is sent in `Authorization` header
    
- Why we validate token in middleware
    

**Mini Task:**  
Write a token-protected route:  
`GET /dashboard` → requires JWT.

---

# ⭐ **DAY 8 – Authorization (Roles)**

Learn:

- Admin vs User
    
- Role-based routes (RBAC)
    
- Example: only admin can delete users
    

**Mini Task:**  
Design route:

```
DELETE /users/:id  (admin only)
```

---

# ⭐ **DAY 9 – Pagination, Filtering & Sorting**

Learn:

- Why not return 10,000 items
    
- Clean pagination design
    
- Filter by status (`?status=pending`)
    
- Sort by date (`?sortBy=createdAt&order=desc`)
    

**Mini Task:**  
Design:

```
GET /orders?page=1&limit=20&status=shipped
```

---

# ⭐ **DAY 10 – API Versioning**

Learn:

- Why V1, V2 exist
    
- Breaking changes
    
- URL format: `/api/v1/users`
    

**Mini Task:**  
Create v1 and v2 route examples for products.

---

# ⭐ **DAY 11 – Rate Limiting & Security Basics**

Learn:

- Why we block too many requests
    
- 429 Too Many Requests
    
- Helmet middleware
    
- API keys (basic idea)
    

**Mini Task:**  
Plan a rate limit for login:

- 5 attempts per minute
    

---

# ⭐ **DAY 12 – Designing Advanced APIs**

Learn:

- Analytics APIs
    
- Dashboard APIs
    
- Report APIs
    
- Stats endpoints
    

**Mini Task:**  
Design:

```
GET /analytics/tasks-by-status
```

---

# ⭐ **DAY 13 – Using Tools**

Learn:

- Postman
    
- Swagger / OpenAPI
    
- Testing your APIs
    
- Writing documentation
    

**Mini Task:**  
Make a Postman collection for 4–5 APIs.

---

# ⭐ **DAY 14 – Full Project API Design**

Now you design APIs for a full project:  
Choose one:

- Todo App
    
- Notes App
    
- E-commerce
    
- URL Shortener
    
- Blog Platform
    
- Chat App
    

**Deliverables:**

- API routes table
    
- Request & response format
    
- Error responses
    
- Auth design
    
- Pagination
    
- Analytics endpoints
    

If you want, I can guide you through all 14 days personally.

---

# ⭐ **BONUS: API Design Golden Rules You Should Never Forget**

- Keep URL simple
    
- Keep routes predictable
    
- Use correct HTTP methods
    
- Return consistent responses
    
- Validate inputs
    
- Protect private routes
    
- Add pagination
    
- Use meaningful error messages
    
- Don’t mix frontend logic in backend
    

These rules alone make you look like a **real backend engineer**.

---

# ⭐ Want the next step?

If you want, I can also give you:

👉 A complete _Task Manager API Design_ (all routes, requests, responses)  
👉 A _Postman collection_  
👉 A _project folder structure_  
👉 A _MongoDB schema plan_  
👉 A _real API design assignment_ (like companies use)

Just say **“give me that also”** and I’ll prepare it.

Perfect Rahul — here is a **real API Design Assignment** exactly like the ones startups and product-based companies give during backend interviews.  
This is **industry-style**, simple to understand, and helps you think like a real backend engineer.

I’ll keep everything in clean English and make sure it feels friendly and motivating.

---

# ⭐ **REAL API DESIGN ASSIGNMENT (Startup-Level)**

## **Project: “TaskMaster Pro” – A Team Task Management System**

This is like Trello / Jira (small version).

You must design **clean APIs** for:

- User Authentication

- Team Collaboration
    
- Analytics
    

This assignment tests:

- API naming
    
- URL structure
    
- Request/response
    
- Filters
    
- Pagination
    
- Auth
    
- Permissions
    
- Clean thinking
    

Exactly what companies want.

---

# ⭐ **1. User Authentication API**

### ✔ **POST /auth/register**

Create a new user.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Rahul",
  "email": "rahul@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

---

### ✔ **POST /auth/login**

Login user and return a token.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "rahul@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

---

# ⭐ **2. Team API**

### ✔ **POST /teams** (JWT required)

Create a team.

```json
{
  "teamName": "Backend Ninjas"
}
```

---

### ✔ **POST /teams/:teamId/members**

Add a member to the team.

  "email": "member@example.com",
  "role": "member"
}
```

Roles:

- **owner**
    
- **admin**
    
- **member**
    

---

### ✔ **GET /teams/:teamId/members**

List all members of a team.

---

# ⭐ **3. Task Management API**

### ✔ **POST /teams/:teamId/tasks**

Create a task inside a team.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "title": "Design API endpoints",
  "description": "Prepare API structure",
  "status": "todo",
  "priority": "high",
  "assignedTo": "userId123",
  "dueDate": "2025-02-01"
}
```

Statuses:

- todo
    
- inProgress
    
- done
    

Priorities:

- low
    
- medium
    
- high
    

---

### ✔ **GET /teams/:teamId/tasks**

List all tasks with filtering + pagination.

**Query Params:**

```
?page=1&limit=10&status=todo&priority=high&assignedTo=userId123
```

Companies love this!

---

### ✔ **GET /teams/:teamId/tasks/:taskId**

Get a single task.

---

### ✔ **PUT /teams/:teamId/tasks/:taskId**

Update a task (any field).

---

### ✔ **DELETE /teams/:teamId/tasks/:taskId**

Delete a task.

---

# ⭐ **4. Comments API (Very common in interviews)**

### ✔ **POST /teams/:teamId/tasks/:taskId/comments**

```json
{
  "message": "I will finish this by evening."
}
```

---

---

# ⭐ **6. Permissions & Role-Based Access (Important)**

Your API design must include:

- **Only team owner/admin** can delete tasks.
    
- **Only assigned user** can mark done.
    
- **Any member** can comment.
    
- **Only owner** can remove members.
    

You don’t need to write code.

Instead of deleting task → mark `isDeleted: true`

### 🔸 Add sorting

```
?sortBy=priority&order=asc
```

---

### 1. **API Route Table**

All routes + methods + purpose.

### 2. **Request Body Format**

For each POST/PUT API.

### 3. **Response Format**

Success + error response.

### 4. **Filtering + Pagination**

For task listing.

### 5. **Role-based access design**
