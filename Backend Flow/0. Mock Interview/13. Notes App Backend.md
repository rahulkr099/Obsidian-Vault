Alright Rahul, here comes a clean and interview-ready **Backend Machine Coding Round** mock question for a **Notes App Backend**.  
This pattern is very popular because it tests **CRUD, querying, tagging, search, and multiple state flags** like archive & pinning — similar to Google Keep.

I’ll keep it in simple words but deep enough for real-world interviews.

# 📝 **Backend Machine Coding Round — Notes App Backend**

### ⏱ Time Limit: 60–75 minutes

### 🎯 Goal: Build a backend service with:

- CRUD for notes
    
- Tags
    
- Archive / Unarchive
    
- Pin / Unpin
    
- Search
    
- Clean modeling + good API design
    

---

# 📦 **Note Model Structure**

Each note should have:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Shopping List",
  "content": "Buy milk, bread, eggs",
  "tags": ["grocery", "urgent"],
  "isArchived": false,
  "isPinned": false,
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

---

# 🔧 **Required Endpoints**

```
POST    /notes
GET     /notes
GET     /notes/:id
PUT     /notes/:id
DELETE  /notes/:id

PUT     /notes/:id/archive
PUT     /notes/:id/unarchive
PUT     /notes/:id/pin
PUT     /notes/:id/unpin
```

---

# 💡 **Functional Requirements**

### **1️⃣ Create Note — POST /notes**

Input:

```json
{
  "title": "Ideas",
  "content": "Build a new project",
  "tags": ["project", "ideas"]
}
```

Rules:

- title required
    
- content optional
    
- tags optional array of strings
    
- isArchived = false
    
- isPinned = false
    
- createdAt, updatedAt timestamps
    

---

### **2️⃣ Get All Notes — GET /notes**

Support filtering:

- `?tag=work` → notes that include this tag
    
- `?search=milk` → search title OR content
    
- `?status=archived|active`
    
- `?pinned=true`
    
- Pagination:
    
    ```
    ?page=1&limit=10
    ```
    

Sorting:

- optionally sort by `createdAt` or `updatedAt`.
    

Must return:

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 10,
  "total": 42,
  "data": [ ...notes ]
}
```

---

### **3️⃣ Get Single Note — GET /notes/:id**

Return full note.

404 if not found.

---

### **4️⃣ Update Note — PUT /notes/:id**

Updates any field:

- title
    
- content
    
- tags
    

Rules:

- title cannot be empty
    
- update timestamps
    

---

### **5️⃣ Delete Note — DELETE /notes/:id**

Remove note permanently.

---

### **6️⃣ Archive Note — PUT /notes/:id/archive**

Set `isArchived = true`.

### **7️⃣ Unarchive — PUT /notes/:id/unarchive**

Set `isArchived = false`.

---

### **8️⃣ Pin Note — PUT /notes/:id/pin**

Set `isPinned = true`.

Pinned notes should appear **before** non-pinned notes in GET responses.

### **9️⃣ Unpin — PUT /notes/:id/unpin**

Set `isPinned = false`.

---

# 🔎 **Search Features**

Search must check:

- title (partial match)
    
- content (partial match)
    
- case-insensitive
    

You may use:

- SQL: `LIKE %query%`
    
- MongoDB: regex
    
- Bonus: full-text search
    

---

# 🧪 **Edge Cases to Handle**

- title empty → reject
    
- tags: null or non-array → reject
    
- Updating tags to empty array → allowed
    
- Searching with empty query → return everything
    
- Searching with special characters → sanitize input
    
- Archive + pin conflict:
    
    - Pinned archived notes → should stay under archived section
        
- Pagination:
    
    - page < 1 → default=1
        
    - limit < 1 → default=10
        
- Deleting an archived or pinned note should still work
    
- Fetching by tag when no notes match → empty list
    

---

# 🧱 **Backend Logic Requirements**

- pinned notes must appear before others
    
- archived notes should not show unless explicitly filtered
    
- search + tags + archived filters must combine correctly
    
- indexing:
    
    - add index on title
        
    - add index on tags
        
    - add index on isArchived
        
    - optional: text index on content

# ⭐ **Interviewer Follow-Up Questions**

1. How would you implement **full-text search** for content?
    
2. How would you store **tags** efficiently?
    
3. How would you handle **pagination at scale** for millions of notes?
    
4. How would you implement a **trash** (soft-delete) system like Google Keep?
    
5. How would you add **reminders** per note?
    
6. How would you add **collaboration** (multiple users editing notes)?
    
7. How would you handle **conflicts** if two users edit the same note?
    
8. How would you add **version history** for notes?

- Multi-tag filtering: `?tags=work,urgent`
    
- Pinned + archived grouping
    
- Markdown support in notes
    
- Note color themes
    
- Sharing notes with other users
    
- Export notes to PDF or Markdown
