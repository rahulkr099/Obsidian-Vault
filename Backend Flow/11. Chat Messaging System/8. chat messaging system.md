Great choice 👍  
Below is **clean, whiteboard-friendly PSEUDOCODE** for the **Chat Messaging System**.  
No framework syntax, no Mongo queries — only **logic, flow, and decisions** you can explain clearly in an interview.

# 💬 Chat Messaging System — Pseudocode (1-Hour Interview Ready)

---

## 1. Goal of the System

```
GOAL:
Allow users to chat in real time (1:1)
Persist messages
Show online/offline presence
Support delivery & read acknowledgements
(Optional wow: typing indicator)
```

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```
Client
  ↓ (REST)
Server (Auth + History APIs)
  ↓ (WebSocket)
Real-time Messaging Layer
  ↓
Database (Users, Conversations, Messages)
```

## 9. Message Delivery Acknowledgement ⭐

```
WHEN receiver gets message

  Send ack:
    messageId
    status = "delivered"
```

```
WHEN server receives ack

  Update message status in database

  Broadcast to conversation:
    event: "message_status_update"
```

---

## 10. Read Receipt (Optional Wow)

```
WHEN user opens conversation

  Send ack:
    messageId
    status = "read"
```

```
Server updates message status
Broadcasts updated status
```

---

## 11. Typing Indicator (Easy Wow ⭐)

```
WHEN client sends typing(conversationId, isTyping)

  Forward event to other users in conversation:
    userId
    isTyping
```

---

## 12. Presence Tracking

```
WHEN user connects
  Mark online
  Broadcast presence = online
```

```
WHEN user disconnects
  Mark offline
  Update lastSeen timestamp
  Broadcast presence = offline
```

---

## 13. Fetch Conversations (REST)

```
WHEN GET /conversations

  Identify user from token

  Find conversations where:
    userId is participant

  Sort by last updated

  RETURN conversations
```

---

## 14. Fetch Messages (Pagination)

```
WHEN GET /conversations/:id/messages

  Validate conversationId

  Fetch messages:
    conversationId
    ordered by createdAt
    limited by page size

  RETURN messages
```

---

## 15. Error Handling

```
401 → invalid token
404 → conversation not found
400 → invalid input
500 → server error
```

---

## 16. Full Message Flow (Say This in Interview)

```
User connects
  ↓
Joins conversation room
  ↓
Sends message (optimistic UI)
  ↓
Server saves + broadcasts
  ↓
Receiver sends delivery ACK
  ↓
Read receipt updates status
```

## 17. 1-Minute Interview Explanation (Use This)

> “I built a real-time chat system using WebSockets for instant delivery and REST for history.  
> Messages are stored in the database and sent optimistically using a temporary ID.  
> Delivery and read acknowledgements update message status in real time.  
> Presence and typing indicators improve user experience.”

## 18. WOW Features to Highlight 🚀

- Optimistic UI with tempId
    
- Delivery & read receipts
    
- Typing indicator
    
- Online/offline presence
    
- Pagination for chat history
    

---

## 19. Forward-Thinking Improvements

- Redis pub/sub for multi-server scaling
    
- Offline message queue
    
- Push notifications (FCM/APNs)
    
- Message search (text index)
    
- End-to-end encryption
    
- Rate limiting & spam protection

## Final Confidence Tip 💪

If you clearly explain:

- **Why WebSockets**
    
- **How optimistic UI works**
    
- **Why ACKs are needed**
    

👉 You will sound like a **strong backend engineer**, not a beginner.
