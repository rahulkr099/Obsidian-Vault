Perfect 👍  
Now let’s **compress the Bank Transfer system into clean, interview-ready PSEUDOCODE** that you can **write fast, explain clearly, and defend confidently** in a 1-hour machine-coding round.

Simple words. Clear logic. Strong fundamentals.

# 🧠 Bank Transfer System (ACID) — **PSEUDOCODE**

---

## 🧱 1. Core Components

```text
Components:
- Account Table / Collection
- Transaction / Session Manager
- Transfer Service
- Optional Ledger (for audit)
```

---


---

## 🔄 3. Money Transfer Flow (High Level)

```text
Start transaction
  ↓
Validate accounts
  ↓
Check balance
  ↓
Debit sender
  ↓
Credit receiver
  ↓
Commit transaction
```

If **any step fails → rollback everything**.

## 🔄 11. Retry Logic (Optional WOW)

```text
IF transaction fails due to transient error:
  RETRY up to N times
```

---

## 🧪 12. Test Scenarios (Say This Confidently)

```text
- Insufficient balance
- Same sender & receiver
- Concurrent transfers from same account
- Crash before commit
```

---

## 🧠 13. Full Flow Summary (One Look)

```text
Client
  ↓
Transfer request
  ↓
Start DB transaction
  ↓
Debit + Credit
  ↓
Commit OR Rollback
  ↓
Return result
```

---

## ⭐ WOW FEATURES YOU CAN MENTION

```text
- ACID transactions
- Ledger / audit trail
- Idempotency key
- Optimistic locking
- Retry on transient failures
- Event emission (Kafka / queue)
```

---

## 🎯 60-Second Interview Explanation (Golden Lines)

> “I use database transactions to ensure atomic debit and credit.  
> If anything fails, the entire operation rolls back.  
> This guarantees no money is lost or duplicated, even under failures or concurrency.”

That sentence alone sounds **very strong and production-ready**.

---

## 🚀 Easy Extensions (If Asked)

```text
- Two-phase commit for microservices
- Daily reconciliation jobs
- Fraud detection rules
- Notifications system
```
