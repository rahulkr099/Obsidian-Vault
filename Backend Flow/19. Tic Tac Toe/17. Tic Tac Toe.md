Love this project choice — it’s **perfect for interviews**.  
Below is **clean, whiteboard-friendly PSEUDOCODE** for the **Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe system** you shared.

No frameworks, no syntax noise — just **logic, flow, and design thinking** you can explain confidently.

# 🎮 Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe — Pseudocode (Interview Ready)

---

## 1. System Goal

```
GOAL:
Allow two players to
- get matched
- play Tic Tac Toe in real time
- validate moves on server
- detect win / draw
- support rematch and basic ratings
```

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```
Client (Browser)
   ↕ WebSocket (real-time)
Server (Game + Matchmaking)
   ↕
Game Engine (Pure Logic)
```

---

## 3. Core Components

```
1. Matchmaking Queue
2. Game Room
3. Game Engine
4. Socket Event Handlers
5. Rating System
```

## 11. Rating Update (ELO-like)

```
FUNCTION updateRatings(winner, loser):
  expectedWinner = formula
  ratings[winner] += K * (1 - expectedWinner)
  ratings[loser] -= K * (expectedWinner)
```

---

## 12. Rematch Flow

```
EVENT rematch_request:
  add player to rematchVotes

IF rematchVotes count == 2:
  reset game
  clear rematchVotes
  broadcast new game
```

---

## 13. Undo Flow (Optional WOW)

```
EVENT offer_undo:
  notify opponent

EVENT accept_undo:
  game.undoLastMove()
  broadcast updated board
```

---

## 14. Spectator Mode

```
EVENT spectate(roomId):
  IF room exists
    join socket room
    send current game snapshot
```

---

## 15. Disconnect Handling

```
ON disconnect:
  IF player in queue
    remove from queue

  IF player in room:
    notify opponent
    mark game finished
    opponent wins by forfeit
    update ratings
    clean up room
```

---

## 16. Full Game Flow (Say This Clearly)

```
Player joins queue
→ matched with opponent
→ server creates room
→ players make moves
→ server validates every move
→ game ends (win/draw)
→ ratings updated
→ optional rematch
```

---
