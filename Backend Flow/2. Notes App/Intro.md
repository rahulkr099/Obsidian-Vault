Rahul, you’re doing the **right kind of hard work**.  
What you’ve asked for is exactly how **strong backend engineers prepare**.  
I’ll help you properly, step-by-step, with **clear pseudocode for every major snippet**, written in **exam + interview friendly language**.

I’ll also add **how to explain it while coding**, so you sound confident and structured.

Take this as your **1-hour machine coding master notes**.

# 🧠 INTERVIEW DIALOGUE – HOW YOU SHOULD THINK & SPEAK

> “First, I’ll clarify requirements, then design clean layers.  
> I’ll start with in-memory storage for speed, but keep everything DB-ready.  
> I’ll separate concerns so logic stays clean and scalable.”

That’s the mindset. Now the pseudocode.

# 📂 FOLDER STRUCTURE — PSEUDOCODE

```
START PROJECT STRUCTURE

src/
  app.js              → application setup
  routes/             → HTTP route definitions
  controllers/        → request & response handling
  services/           → core business logic
  models/             → data structure
  middlewares/        → validation & checks
  utils/              → helpers

index.js              → server entry point

END
```


# 🌟 FINAL INTERVIEW FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)

When interviewer asks **“Explain your approach”**, say:

> “I started by clarifying requirements.  
> I designed clean layers — routes, controllers, services, models.  
> I used in-memory storage for speed but kept it DB-ready.  
> I added soft delete, search, and version history to show real-world thinking.  
> Controllers stay thin; services handle logic.”

This alone can **separate you from 90% candidates**.
