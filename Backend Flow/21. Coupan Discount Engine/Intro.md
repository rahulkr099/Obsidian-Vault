Perfect, Rahul 👍  
Below is **clean, interview-ready PSEUDOCODE** for the **Coupon / Discount Engine**.  
This is exactly what you’d write or explain in a **machine-coding / system design round** — simple words, clear flow, no framework noise.

# 🧾 Coupon / Discount Engine — **PSEUDOCODE**

---

## 1️⃣ High-Level Goal (Say this first)

```
Build a service that:
- Creates coupons
- Validates coupons
- Applies discount on an order
- Enforces expiry, usage limits, and user limits
- Supports percentage and flat discounts
- Can auto-select the best coupon
```

## 10️⃣ Time Complexity (Say This)

```
Apply Coupon: O(1)
Best Coupon Selection: O(N) where N = number of coupons
```

---

## 11️⃣ How to Explain in Interview (One-Liner)

> “I built a coupon engine that validates expiry, usage limits, and user limits, calculates discounts dynamically, and can auto-select the best coupon for an order.”

---

## 12️⃣ Forward-Thinking Improvements 🚀

```
- Rule-based coupon engine (JSON rules)
- Redis cache for active coupons
- Analytics: most used coupon, total discount given
- Fraud detection using IP / device fingerprint
- Coupon recommendation engine
```

---

## 13️⃣ Final Interview Checklist ✅

```
✔ Clean validations
✔ Correct discount math
✔ No misuse
✔ Idempotent design
✔ Extendable architecture
```

Rahul, this is **exactly** the level interviewers expect for backend machine coding.  
If you want next, I can:

- Convert this into **system design diagram**
    
- Add **SQL version pseudocode**
    
- Add **Redis-optimized version**
    
- Create **Postman test cases**
    
- Prepare **30-second explanation**
    

Just say the word 🚀
