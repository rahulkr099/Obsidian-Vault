## 🎯 60-Second Interview Explanation (Golden Lines)

> “The API streams CSV input row-by-row and converts it to JSON without loading the whole file in memory.  
> It supports NDJSON for large datasets and normal JSON for small ones.  
> This keeps memory usage low and works well for big files.”

That sounds **clean, scalable, and professional**.
