Perfect 👍  
Now let’s **compress the Image Processing API into clean, interview-ready PSEUDOCODE** you can **write fast, explain clearly, and extend confidently** in a 1-hour machine-coding round.

Simple words. Clear flow. Strong thinking.

# 🧠 Image Processing API — **PSEUDOCODE**

---

## 🧱 1. Core Components

```text
Components:
- HTTP API (Express)
- File Upload Handler (multer)
- Image Processor (Sharp)
- Storage (Local disk / S3)
- Optional Job Queue (for heavy processing)
- Optional Cache (thumbnails / results)
```

## 🔄 11. API Flow Summary

```text
Client
  ↓
POST /upload
  ↓
Store original image
  ↓
POST /process
  ↓
Sharp pipeline OR async job
  ↓
Return processed image URL
```

## ⭐ 12. Built-in WOW Features (Say Confidently)

```text
- Streaming image processing
- Operation chaining
- Sync + async processing
- Background workers for heavy tasks
- Thumbnail caching
- Watermark generation
- Storage abstraction (local → S3)
```

## 🎯 60-Second Interview Explanation (Golden Script)

> “Images are uploaded and stored first.  
> Processing uses Sharp with a chained pipeline.  
> Small operations run synchronously, heavy ones go to a background job queue.  
> The system is stateless, scalable, and optimized for performance and cost.”

That sounds **clean, mature, and production-ready**.

## 🚀 Easy Extensions (If Asked)

```text
- URL-based transforms (?w=300&h=200)
- WebSocket job progress
- CDN caching
- EXIF extraction / OCR
- Deduplication using perceptual hash
- Auto-crop / background removal
```
