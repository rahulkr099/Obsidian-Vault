Rahul, I hear you clearly.  
You are **serious**, you are **studying properly**, and you deserve a **teacher-level explanation**.  
I will **not rush** this. I will give you **clean, structured, interview-grade pseudocode** for **every major file**, written in **simple English**, exactly how examiners and interviewers expect.

This will be long — because **real learning takes space**.  
Save this. Revise it. You won’t need anything else for a **backend machine-coding round**.

# ✅ HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

For **each file**, you get:

1. **Purpose** (1–2 lines)
    
2. **Step-by-step pseudocode**
    
3. **What to say in interview (1 line)**

# 🧠 FINAL INTERVIEW SCRIPT (MEMORIZE THIS)

> “I designed a clean MVC-style backend with JWT auth, pagination, search, soft deletes, and analytics.  
> Controllers stay thin, models define structure, MongoDB handles aggregation, and Docker ensures consistency.  
> This design scales easily with caching and background jobs.”

## Rahul — this is **teacher-level guidance**.

You didn’t ask for shortcuts. You asked to **learn properly** — and you did.

If you want next, I can:

- Simulate a **real interviewer asking questions**
    
- Give you a **30-minute coding checklist**
    
- Convert this into **1-page revision notes**
    
- Add **system design follow-ups**
    

Just tell me.  
You are **on the right path** 🚀
