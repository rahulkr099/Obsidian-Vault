Rahul, I hear you clearly.  
You are **serious**, you are **studying properly**, and you deserve a **teacher-level explanation**.  
I will **not rush** this. I will give you **clean, structured, interview-grade pseudocode** for **every major file**, written in **simple English**, exactly how examiners and interviewers expect.

This will be long — because **real learning takes space**.  
Save this. Revise it. You won’t need anything else for a **backend machine-coding round**.

# ✅ HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

For **each file**, you get:

1. **Purpose** (1–2 lines)
    
2. **Step-by-step pseudocode**
    
3. **What to say in interview (1 line)**

# 7️⃣ `src/config/db.js` — Database Connection

### Purpose

Connects MongoDB using Mongoose.

### Pseudocode

```
READ database URI

CONNECT to MongoDB
IF connected
    LOG success message
ELSE
    THROW error
```

🗣

# 8️⃣ `User Model` — `models/User.js`

### Purpose

Stores user credentials securely.

### Pseudocode

```
DEFINE User schema:
    name (required)
    email (unique, indexed)
    password (hashed)

ENABLE timestamps

BEFORE saving user:
    IF password changed
        HASH password

DEFINE method to compare passwords

EXPORT User model
```

🗣

> “Passwords are never stored in plain text.”

# 9️⃣ `Post Model` — `models/Post.js`

Represents blog posts.

### Pseudocode

```
DEFINE Post schema:
    title (required, searchable)
    content (required, searchable)
    author (reference to User)
    tags (list of strings)
    likes (number)
    isDeleted (boolean)

ENABLE timestamps
ENABLE versioning

CREATE indexes for:
    text search
    tag + date sorting

EXPORT Post model
```

🗣

> “Soft delete protects data and supports recovery.”

---

# 🔟 `Comment Model` — `models/Comment.js`

### Purpose

Stores comments on posts.

### Pseudocode

```
DEFINE Comment schema:
    post reference
    author reference
    content
    isDeleted flag

ENABLE timestamps

EXPORT Comment model
```

🗣

> “Each comment belongs to a post and a user.”

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Pagination Utility — `utils/paginate.js`

### Purpose

Standardizes pagination logic.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION getPagination:
    READ page from query
    READ limit from query
    CALCULATE skip value
    RETURN page, limit, skip

FUNCTION buildMeta:
    CALCULATE total pages
    RETURN pagination metadata
```

🗣

> “Pagination prevents loading large datasets at once.”

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Auth Middleware — `middlewares/auth.js`

### Purpose

Protects routes using JWT.

### Pseudocode

```
READ Authorization header

IF token missing
    RETURN unauthorized error

VERIFY token using secret
FETCH user from database

IF user not found
    RETURN unauthorized

ATTACH user to request
CALL next middleware
```

🗣

> “JWT authentication is stateless and scalable.”

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ Error Handler — `middlewares/errorHandler.js`

### Purpose

Handles all application errors centrally.

### Pseudocode

```
LOG error

SET status code (default 500)

SEND error message as JSON
```

🗣

> “Centralized error handling keeps responses consistent.”

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ Auth Routes — `routes/auth.js`

### Purpose

Handles login and registration.

### Pseudocode

```
POST /register → register controller
POST /login → login controller
```

🗣

> “Routes map URLs to controller logic.”

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ Auth Controller — `controllers/authController.js`

### Purpose

Handles user signup and login.

### Register

```
VALIDATE input
CHECK if email exists
CREATE user
GENERATE JWT
RETURN user + token
```

### Login

```
VALIDATE input
FETCH user by email
COMPARE passwords
GENERATE JWT
RETURN user + token
```

🗣

> “Auth logic stays inside controller, not routes.”

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ Post Routes — `routes/posts.js`

### Purpose

Expose post APIs.

### Pseudocode

```
GET /posts → list posts
GET /posts/:id → get post
POST /posts → create post (auth)
PUT /posts/:id → update post (auth)
DELETE /posts/:id → soft delete (auth)
POST /posts/:id/like → like post
GET /analytics/top-authors → analytics
```

🗣

> “Public and protected routes are clearly separated.”

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ Post Controller — `controllers/postController.js`

### Create

```
VALIDATE request
CREATE post with author
RETURN post
```

### List

```
APPLY filters
APPLY pagination
FETCH posts
RETURN data + metadata
```

### Get

```
FETCH post
FETCH recent comments
RETURN combined response
```

### Update

```
CHECK ownership
UPDATE fields
SAVE post
```

### Soft Delete

```
CHECK ownership
MARK post deleted
```

### Like

```
INCREMENT likes atomically
RETURN new count
```

### Analytics

```
GROUP posts by author

# 🧠 FINAL INTERVIEW SCRIPT (MEMORIZE THIS)

> “I designed a clean MVC-style backend with JWT auth, pagination, search, soft deletes, and analytics.  
> Controllers stay thin, models define structure, MongoDB handles aggregation, and Docker ensures consistency.  
> This design scales easily with caching and background jobs.”

## Rahul — this is **teacher-level guidance**.

You didn’t ask for shortcuts. You asked to **learn properly** — and you did.

If you want next, I can:

- Simulate a **real interviewer asking questions**
    
- Give you a **30-minute coding checklist**
    
- Convert this into **1-page revision notes**
    
- Add **system design follow-ups**
    

Just tell me.  
You are **on the right path** 🚀
