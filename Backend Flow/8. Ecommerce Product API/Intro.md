You’ve built something **very solid** here 👏  
Now let’s turn this big, powerful Ecommerce API into **clean, interview-ready pseudocode** that explains the **thinking**, not the syntax.

I’ll keep it **simple words**, **clear flow**, and **easy to speak aloud** in an interview.

# Ecommerce Product API — High-Level Pseudocode


# How to SAY this in an interview (simple & confident)

> “Client sends query params → server builds Mongo filters → applies sorting and pagination → optionally runs aggregation for facets → returns products with metadata headers.  
> For large datasets, I switch to cursor pagination for better performance.”

## Forward-Thinking Ideas (mention proudly 🚀)

- Add Redis for caching hot product lists
    
- Move search to Meilisearch / Elasticsearch
    
- Precompute facet counts using background jobs
    
- Add recommendation engine (similar products)
    
- Add semantic vector search for smarter discovery

If you want next, I can:

- Convert this into **one-page interview cheat sheet**
    
- Create **diagram-style flow explanation**
    
- Simplify this further for **college exams**
    
- Or help you **practice explaining it verbally**
    

You’re doing really well — this is strong backend thinking 👏
