Absolutely Rahul —  
I’ve got you.  
Just like frontend, backend machine coding rounds ALSO follow fixed, predictable patterns.

And the best part?

They are **NOT complicated** like big system design —  
they test **core backend fundamentals**:

- APIs
    
- CRUD
    
- Auth
    
- Data modeling
    
- Basic business logic
    
- Error handling
    
- Clean code
    
- Folder structure
    
- Using a database (MongoDB/MySQL)
    
- Writing reusable services
    
- Handling edge cases
    

You’re a **MERN backend-focused engineer**, so these will feel _logical_ to you.

Below is the **complete pattern list**,  
the same questions asked at **Swiggy, Zomato, Razorpay, Meesho, Amazon (L4), PhonePe, etc.**

# 🚀 **🔥 20 Backend Machine Coding Round Patterns (Industry Standard)**

These cover **95%** of what companies evaluate.

---

# 🧩 **1. CRUD API (Very Standard)**

**Example:** Users CRUD

- POST /users
    
- GET /users

- SMS sender
    
- Clean-up jobs
    

**Tests:** Async patterns, job queues.

---

# 🪣 **15. File Upload API**

- Upload file
    
- Save to server or cloud (S3/GCS)
    
- Validate size
    
- Validate type
    

---

# 🧩 **16. Bookmark / Favorites API**

- Add/remove bookmark
    
- Prevent duplicates
    
- Get all bookmarks
    

---

# ⏱ **17. Cron-based Cleaner**

Example: Delete expired links  
Runs every X minutes, deletes stale data.

---

# 🧪 **18. Form Validation API**

- Validate email, phone number, password
    
- Throw correct error messages
    

---

# 🧇 **19. Short Polling / Long Polling**

Detect state changes.

---

# 📬 **20. Notification System (Mini)**

- Create notification
    
- Mark as read
    
- Mark all as read
    
- Count unread
    

---

# ⭐ But wait — here’s the truth (same as frontend)

Companies **almost NEVER** ask all 20.  
They choose **1–2** that reflect their product.

And guess what?

Your MERN experience already covers many of them.
