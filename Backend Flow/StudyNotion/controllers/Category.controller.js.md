Nice 👍  
This is a **real backend controller**, so let’s do what you asked:  
**very detailed, step-by-step pseudocode**, written slowly and clearly, **file by file, function by function**, no shortcuts.

I’ll keep words simple and logic explicit so you can:

- explain it in interviews
    
- convert it to flowcharts
    
- refactor later into services easily
