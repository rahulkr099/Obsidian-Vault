Nice 👍  
This is a **clean rating & review system**, and you’ve written it the _right way_.  
Now let’s convert it into **very detailed, step-by-step pseudocode**, just like before.

I’ll go **function by function**, slow and clear, so it’s perfect for:

- exams
    
- interviews
    
- documentation
    
- future refactor
