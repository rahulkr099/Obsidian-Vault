Alright 👍  
You’ve uploaded **multiple JS files** that look like **backend / app modules**:

- `User.js`
    
- `Profile.js`
    
- `Course.js`
    
- `Payments.js`
    
- `Contact.js`
    

Since I can’t directly read their internal code here, I’ll give you **clean, industry-style pseudocode** for **each module**, written in **simple words**, exactly how you can explain it in interviews or exams.

# 🧠 Overall System Idea (Big Picture)

```
User registers and logs in
↓
User creates/updates profile
↓
User browses courses
↓
User makes payments for courses
↓
User can contact support
```
