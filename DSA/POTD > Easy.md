# 1.  Given a sequence of numbers. Find all leaders in sequence. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements on its right side.
Note:
	 Rightmost element is always a leader.
	 The order of elements in the return sequence must be the same as the given sequence

Example:

The given sequence is 13, 14, 3, 8, 2 .

13 Not a leader because on the right side 14 is greater than 13.
14 lt is a leader because no one greater element in the right side.
3 Not a leader because on the right side 8 are greater than 3.
8 It is a leader because no one greater element on the right side.
2 It is a leader because it is the rightmost element in a sequence.

Hence there are 3 leaders in the above sequence which are 14, 8, 2.
## Answer
## 🔹 What is a Leader?

An element is a **leader** if:
- It is **strictly greater than all elements to its right**
- The **rightmost element is always a leader**
👉 Important:  
The **order of leaders in output must stay the same** as the input.
## 🧠 Key Insight (Smart Thinking)

Instead of checking every element with all elements on the right (which is slow), we can:
### 💡 Scan the array **from right to left**
- Keep track of the **maximum element seen so far**
- If the current element is **greater than max**, it is a leader
- Update max
This works in **O(N)** time (very fast).

---
## ✅ Step-by-Step Approach

1. Start from the **last element**
2. Mark it as leader
3. Move leftwards
4. Compare current element with `max_so_far`
5. If greater → leader
6. Finally reverse the result (to keep original order)

---
## ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time:** `O(N)`
- **Space:** `O(N)` (for storing leaders)


# 2. Given an infinite supply of Indian currency i.e. [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000] valued coins and an amount 'N'.

Find the minimum coins needed to make the sum equal to 'N'. You have to return the list containing the value of coins required in decreasing order.

For Example
For Amount = 70, the minimum number of coins required is 2 i.e an Rs. 50 coin and a Rs. 20 coin.

Note
It is always possible to find the minimum number of coins for the given amount. So, the answer will always exist.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1
13
Sample Output 1
10 2 1
Explanation of Sample Input 1
The minimum number of coins to change is 3 {1, 2, 10}.
Sample Input 2
50
Sample Output 2
50

## Answer
## 🧠 Key Idea (Greedy Thinking)

You are given **Indian currency coins**:

`[1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000]`

To get the **minimum number of coins**:

- Always take the **largest coin possible first**
- Reduce the amount
- Repeat until the amount becomes `0`

This works perfectly for Indian currency 💯

---
## ✅ Why Greedy Works Here?

Indian coins are designed in such a way that:

- Taking the largest denomination first **always leads to minimum coins**
- There is **no tricky case** where greedy fails

That’s why the problem clearly says:

> “It is always possible to find the minimum number of coins”

---

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Example

### Input

`N = 13`

### Process

- Take `10` → remaining `3`
    
- Take `2` → remaining `1`
    
- Take `1` → remaining `0`
    

### Output

`10 2 1`

Coins are printed in **decreasing order** ✔️

## ⏱️ Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` (worst case when N = 1 repeated)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` (to store coins)

Fast enough for `N ≤ 10^5` ✅

# 3. You have been given three distinct integers ‘X’, ‘Y’ and ‘Z’. You need to find the number with a value in the middle.

For example :

```
X = 4, Y = 6, Z = 2
Here the element with value in the middle is 4, because 2 < 4 < 6.
```

Note :

```
You need to try doing it using minimum comparisons.
```

```python
def middleOfThree(x:int, y:int, z:int):

# Write your code here

# Return an integer

if x < y and x < z:

if y < z:

return y

if z < y:

return z

if y < x and y < z:

if x < z:

return x

if z < x:

return z

if z < x and z < y:

if x < y:

return x

if y < x:

return y

 #  4. Shrey has just arrived in the city. When he entered the city, he was given two strings. Now, after arriving at his college, his professor gave him an extra string. To check his intelligence, his professor told him to check if the third string given to him has all the characters of the first and second strings in any order. Help Shrey before his professor scolds him. He has to answer “YES” if all characters are present else “NO”.

```
Example: ‘HELLO’ and ‘SHREY’ are two initial strings, and his professor gave him ’HLOHEELSRY’. So, here all the characters are present, so he has to say “YES”.

Note: The strings contain only uppercase Latin characters.

Explanation For Sample Input 1:

In the first test case, the string ‘THIRD’ has all the characters present in the strings ‘FIRST’ and ‘SECOND’. So, we will return “YES”.

In the second test case, the strings ‘FIRST’ and ‘SECOND’ combined have 1 N, 1 Y, 1 E, 1 S and 1 O. While the string ‘THIRD’ has 1 N, 1 Y, 2 E, 1 S and 2 O and So, it has one character more than ‘FIRST’ and ‘SECOND’. Thus, we will return “NO”.
```

## 🧠 Key Insight (Very Important)

This is **NOT** about substring  
This is **NOT** about order

This is about **character frequency (count)**.

---

# 🧪 Approach 1: Brute Force (Easy but Slow)

### 💡 Idea

- For every character in FIRST and SECOND
- Try to find and remove it from THIRD
- If at any point a character is missing → NO

---

### 🪜 Steps

1. Convert THIRD string into a list (so we can remove characters)
2. Loop through FIRST:
    - If character exists in THIRD → remove it
    - Else → print NO
3. Loop through SECOND:
    - Same logic
4. If all characters matched → YES

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity
- Worst case: **O(N²)**  
    (Searching and removing again and again)

---

### ❌ Why not good?

- Very slow for large strings (up to 10⁵ length)
- Might fail time limit

---

### ✅ When to use?

- Very small input
- Only for understanding logic

---

# ⚡ Approach 2: Better Solution (Sorting Method)

### 💡 Idea

If THIRD contains exactly all characters of FIRST + SECOND:

👉 Then **sorted(FIRST + SECOND) == sorted(THIRD)**

---

### 🪜 Steps

1. Combine FIRST and SECOND → `COMBINED`
2. Sort `COMBINED`
3. Sort `THIRD`
4. Compare both strings:
    - If same → YES
    - Else → NO


---

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- Sorting takes: **O(N log N)**

---

### ✅ Pros

- Easy to write
- Cleaner logic

### ❌ Cons

- Sorting is still costly
- Not the best for huge inputs

---

### 🧠 Exam Tip

If input size is **medium**, sorting is acceptable.

---

# 🚀 Approach 3: Optimal Solution (Frequency Count) ✅

### 💡 Idea (BEST WAY)

- Count characters using an array of size **26**
- Since only **uppercase letters (A–Z)**

---

### 🪜 Steps

1. Create an array `freq[26]` initialized to 0
2. For each character in FIRST:
    - `freq[char - 'A']++`
3. For each character in SECOND:
    - `freq[char - 'A']++`

4. For each character in THIRD:
    - `freq[char - 'A']--`
5. After this:
    - If **all values in freq[] are exactly 0 → YES**
    - Else → NO

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- **O(N)** ✅ (Fastest possible)

### 🧠 Space Complexity

- **O(1)** (Only 26 size array)

---

### 🌟 Why this is BEST?

- Very fast
- Works for large input
- Interview-preferred solution
- Clean and professional

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough (Simple)

**FIRST = "ALL"**  
**SECOND = "GOOD"**

Combined counts:

```
A:1 L:2 G:1 O:2 D:1
```

**THIRD = "ADOLLG"**

```
A:1 L:2 G:1 O:1 D:1 ❌ (O is less)
```

So → **NO**

# 5. You are given a string 'S' of length 'N' consisting of lowercase English alphabet letters. You are also given a positive integer 'K'. Now, a substring of this string is good if it contains at most 'K' distinct characters. A string 'X' is a substring of string 'Y' if it can be obtained by deletion of several continuous elements(possibly zero) from the beginning and the end from the string 'Y'. Your task is to return the maximum size of any good substring of the string 'S'.

**Example:**

```
‘S’ = “bacda” and ‘K’ = 3.

So, the substrings having at most ‘3’ distinct characters are called good substrings. Some possible good substrings are:
1. “bac”
2. “acd”
3. “acda”

The substring “acda” is the largest possible good substring, as we cannot get any other substring of length 5 or more having distinct characters less than or equal to ‘3’. Thus, you should return ‘4’ as the answer.
```

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )

**Constraints:**

```
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= K <= 26
1 <= N <= 10^4

All the characters of the string are lowercase English alphabet letters.

Time Limit: 1 sec
```

**Sample Input 1:**

```
2
2
abcbc
1
abccc
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
4
3
```

**Explanation For Sample Input 1:**

```
For the first test case :
K = 2, so we can choose substring “bcbc” having 2 distinct character which is less than or equal to K = 2. 

We cannot get any other substring of length 5 or more having distinct characters less than or equal to 2. Thus, you should return ‘4’ as the answer.

For the second test case :
K = 1, so we can choose substring “ccc” having only 1 distinct character which is less than or equal to K = 1. 

We cannot get any other substring of length 4 or more having distinct characters less than or equal to 1. Thus, you should return ‘3’ as the answer.
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
1
6
abcba
3
acbdab
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
5
4
```

Nice problem 👍  
This is a **very famous sliding window problem**. I’ll explain it **slowly**, in **simple words**, and in **three levels**:

1. Brute Force
    
2. Better Solution
    
3. Optimal Solution (Sliding Window) ✅
    

I’ll also give **Python code** for each so you can clearly see the difference.

---

## 🔍 Problem Restated (Very Simple)

You are given:

- A string **S**
    
- A number **K**
    

👉 A substring is **good** if it has **at most K distinct characters**.

Your goal:

> **Find the maximum length of any good substring**

---

## 🧠 Key Observation (IMPORTANT)

- “At most K” means **≤ K**
    
- Order must be **continuous** (substring, not subsequence)
    
- We must try **all possible substrings** and pick the **longest valid one**
    

---

# 🧪 1. Brute Force Solution (Easy but Slow)

### 💡 Idea

- Generate **all substrings**
    
- For each substring:
    
    - Count distinct characters
        
    - If distinct ≤ K → update answer
        

---

### 🪜 Steps

1. Fix starting index `i`
    
2. Fix ending index `j`
    
3. Extract substring `S[i:j+1]`
    
4. Count distinct characters using `set`
    
5. Track maximum length
    

---

### 🧑‍💻 Python Code (Brute Force)

```python
def max_good_substring_bruteforce(s, k):
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            substring = s[i:j+1]
            if len(set(substring)) <= k:
                ans = max(ans, j - i + 1)

    return ans
```

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- Substrings: `O(N²)`
    
- Set operation: `O(N)`
    
- ❌ Overall: `O(N³)`
    

---

### ❌ Why not good?

- Too slow for large `N`
    
- Only useful to **understand logic**
    

---

# ⚡ 2. Better Solution (Improved Brute Force)

### 💡 Idea

Instead of recalculating `set()` every time:

- Use a **frequency array**
    
- Extend substring from `i`
    
- Stop when distinct characters exceed `K`
    

---

### 🪜 Steps

1. Fix starting index `i`
    
2. Create frequency array of size 26
    
3. Move `j` forward:
    
    - Update frequency
        
    - Track distinct count
        
4. If distinct > K → break
    

---

### 🧑‍💻 Python Code (Better)

```python
def max_good_substring_better(s, k):
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0

    for i in range(n):
        freq = [0] * 26
        distinct = 0

        for j in range(i, n):
            idx = ord(s[j]) - ord('a')
            if freq[idx] == 0:
                distinct += 1
            freq[idx] += 1

            if distinct > k:
                break

            ans = max(ans, j - i + 1)

    return ans
```

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- `O(N²)` ✅  
    Much better than brute force
    

---

### ✅ When to use?

- Medium constraints
    
- Exam-friendly improvement
    

---

# 🚀 3. Optimal Solution (Sliding Window) ✅

### 💡 Core Idea (BEST)

Use **two pointers (sliding window)**:

- Expand window using `right`
    
- Shrink window using `left` when distinct > K
    

👉 Window always stays **valid**

---

### 🪜 Steps

1. Initialize:
    
    - `left = 0`
        
    - `freq[26]`
        
    - `distinct = 0`
        
2. Move `right` pointer:
    
    - Add character
        
3. If `distinct > K`:
    
    - Move `left` pointer
        
    - Remove characters
        
4. Update maximum length
    

---

### 🧑‍💻 Python Code (Optimal)

```python
def max_good_substring_optimal(s, k):
    n = len(s)
    freq = [0] * 26
    left = 0
    distinct = 0
    ans = 0

    for right in range(n):
        idx = ord(s[right]) - ord('a')
        if freq[idx] == 0:
            distinct += 1
        freq[idx] += 1

        while distinct > k:
            left_idx = ord(s[left]) - ord('a')
            freq[left_idx] -= 1
            if freq[left_idx] == 0:
                distinct -= 1
            left += 1

        ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)

    return ans
```

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- **O(N)** ✅  
    (each character added & removed once)
    

### 🧠 Space Complexity

- **O(1)** (26 characters only)
    

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

**S = "abcbc", K = 2**

Sliding window finds:

```
"bcbc" → length 4 ✅
```

# 6. Given a string ‘STR’ consisting of lower case English letters, the task is to find the first non-repeating character in the string and return it. If it doesn’t exist, return ‘#’.

For example:

```
For the input string 'abcab', the first non-repeating character is ‘c’. As depicted the character ‘a’ repeats at index 3 and character ‘b’ repeats at index 4. Hence we return the character ‘c’ present at index 2.
```

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )

**Constraints:**

```
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 4

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases, and ‘N’ is the length of the string.

Time Limit: 1 sec
```

**Sample Input 1:**

```
2
bbabcbcb
babaabea
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
a
e
```

**Explanation of Sample Input 1:**

```
For the first test case, 
the first non-repeating character is ‘a’. As depicted the character ‘b’ repeats at index 1, 3, 5, 7, and character ‘c’ repeats at index 6. Hence we return the character ‘a’ present at index 2.

For the second test case, 
the character ‘e’ is the first non-repeating character. As depicted the character ‘b’ repeats at index 2, 5, and character ‘a’ repeats at index 3, 4, and 7. Hence we return the character ‘e’ present at index 6.
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```

Great problem 👍 This one is **very common in exams, interviews, and coding practice**.  
Let’s solve it **step by step**, from simple to best.

I’ll explain in **easy words** and give **Python code** (you can easily convert to C++/Java later).

---

# 🧠 Problem in one line

For each string, **find the first character that appears only once**.  
If no such character exists → return `#`.

---

## 🟢 1️⃣ Brute Force Solution (Very simple, slow)

### 👉 Idea

For every character:

- Count how many times it appears in the whole string
    
- If count == 1 → return it
    

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- For each character (N), we scan the string (N)
    
- **O(N²)** ❌ (slow for large input)
    

### 🧾 Space Complexity

- **O(1)**
    

### ✅ Python Code

```python
def firstNonRepeating_bruteforce(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        count = 0
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                count += 1
        if count == 1:
            return s[i]
    return '#'
```

### ✔ Example

```
"abcab" → c
```

---

## 🟡 2️⃣ Better Solution (Using frequency array)

### 👉 Idea

- Count frequency of each character first
    
- Then scan string again to find first char with frequency 1
    

Since only **lowercase letters**, we use array of size 26.

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- Counting → O(N)
    
- Checking → O(N)
    
- **Total: O(N)** ✅
    

### 🧾 Space Complexity

- **O(26) → O(1)**
    

### ✅ Python Code

```python
def firstNonRepeating_better(s):
    freq = [0] * 26

    for ch in s:
        freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

    for ch in s:
        if freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] == 1:
            return ch

    return '#'
```

### ✔ Example

```
"bbabcbcb" → a
```

---

## 🔵 3️⃣ Optimal Solution (Using dictionary / hashmap)

### 👉 Idea

- Use a hashmap (dictionary) to count characters
    
- Preserve order by scanning string again
    

This is **clean, readable, and interview-friendly**.

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- **O(N)** ✅
    

### 🧾 Space Complexity

- **O(N)** (worst case all characters unique)
    

### ✅ Python Code

```python
def firstNonRepeating_optimal(s):
    freq = {}

    for ch in s:
        freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1

    for ch in s:
        if freq[ch] == 1:
            return ch

    return '#'
```

---

## 🧪 Handling Multiple Test Cases

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input().strip()
    print(firstNonRepeating_optimal(s))
```

Nice problem 👍—this one is very common in exams and interviews, so learning it **step by step** is a great idea.

We’ll solve it in **three ways**:

1. Brute force
    
2. Better
    
3. Optimal (best + clean formula)
    

I’ll keep words simple and logic very clear.

---

## 🕒 Basic idea (important to understand first)

- A **clock has 360°**
    
- **Hour hand**
    
    - Moves **30° per hour** (360 ÷ 12)
        
    - Also moves **0.5° per minute** (30 ÷ 60)
        
- **Minute hand**
    
    - Moves **6° per minute** (360 ÷ 60)
        

After finding positions of both hands:

- Take the **absolute difference**
    
- Choose the **minimum angle**
    
- Print the **floor value**
    

---

## 1️⃣ Brute Force Approach (Slow but easy to understand)

### Idea

Simulate how much each hand moves from 12:00.

### Steps

1. Hour hand movement:
    
    - `hour_angle = (H % 12) * 30 + M * 0.5`
        
2. Minute hand movement:
    
    - `minute_angle = M * 6`
        
3. Find difference:
    
    - `angle = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle)`
        
4. Minimum angle:
    
    - `angle = min(angle, 360 - angle)`
        
5. Print `floor(angle)`
    

### Code (Brute Force)

```python
import math

def clock_angle_bruteforce(H, M):
    hour_angle = (H % 12) * 30 + M * 0.5
    minute_angle = M * 6

    angle = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle)
    angle = min(angle, 360 - angle)

    return math.floor(angle)
```

✔ Easy  
❌ Slightly repetitive calculations

## 2️⃣ Better Approach (Cleaner logic)

### Improvement

Same math, but we **directly think in angles**, no simulation feeling.

### Formula

```
angle = |30H - 5.5M|
```

Why?

- Hour hand = `30H + 0.5M`
    
- Minute hand = `6M`
    
- Difference = `|30H + 0.5M - 6M|`
    
- Simplify → `|30H - 5.5M|`
    

### Code (Better)

```python
import math

def clock_angle_better(H, M):
    angle = abs(30 * H - 5.5 * M)
    angle = min(angle, 360 - angle)
    return math.floor(angle)
```

✔ Short  
✔ Faster  
✔ Interview-friendly

## 3️⃣ Optimal Approach (Best & standard)

### Why this is optimal?

- O(1) time
    
- O(1) space
    
- Direct formula
    
- Clean and professional
    

### Final Formula

```
min(|30H - 5.5M|, 360 - |30H - 5.5M|)
```

### Code (Optimal)

```python
import math

def clock_angle_optimal(H, M):
    angle = abs(30 * (H % 12) - 5.5 * M)
    return math.floor(min(angle, 360 - angle))
```

✔ Best for exams  
✔ Best for interviews  
✔ Best for competitive programming

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

### Input: `8 55`

- `|30×8 - 5.5×55|`
    
- `|240 - 302.5| = 62.5`
    
- Minimum = `62.5`
    
- Floor → **62**
    

✔ Output matches sample

---

## 🚀 Extra Tips (for improvement)

- Memorize this formula: **`|30H - 5.5M|`**
    
- Always apply **`min(angle, 360 - angle)`**
    
- Don’t forget **floor value**
    
- Use `(H % 12)` to avoid errors for 12
