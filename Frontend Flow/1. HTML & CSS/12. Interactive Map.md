Great choice 👍  
An **interactive map** is a very practical real-world example.  
Below is **simple, exam-friendly pseudocode** that explains how this Leaflet map works step by step.

# **Pseudocode: Interactive Map Using Leaflet**

---

## **START**

---

## **INITIAL SETUP**

```
CREATE a container area for the map
SET map height and width
```

---

## **CREATE MAP**

```
INITIALIZE map inside the container
SET initial map center using latitude and longitude
SET initial zoom level
```

---

## **ADD MAP TILES**

```
LOAD map tiles from OpenStreetMap server
ADD tile layer to the map
```

---

## **ADD MARKER**

```
CREATE a marker at given latitude and longitude
ADD marker to the map
```

---

## **ADD POPUP TO MARKER**

```
ATTACH popup message to marker
DISPLAY popup on map
```

---

## **END**

---

## 🧠 Simple Explanation

• Map is created inside a page container  
• Tiles are loaded from OpenStreetMap  
• Map is centered at a specific location  
• A marker is placed on the map  
• Clicking marker shows popup text

This uses a **map library (Leaflet)** to handle complex map behavior easily.

## 🚀 Smart Improvements You Can Try Next

To make this more powerful:

- Add **multiple markers**
    
- Get **user’s live location**
    
- Add **click-to-add marker**
    
- Show **coordinates on click**
    
- Use **custom marker icons**
    

If you want, I can:

- Implement **user location tracking**
    
- Add **multiple dynamic markers**
    
- Write **flowchart**
    
- Convert this into **React Leaflet version**
