## 🌍 What is Web Accessibility? (In Simple Words)

Web accessibility means:

> **Everyone** can use your website  

> Including:
- Screen reader users (blind / low vision)
- Keyboard-only users
- People with motor difficulties
- People with cognitive or learning issues

Accessibility is about **good HTML + small extra hints**.

## ✅ What You Already Did RIGHT (Good Job)

Let’s go line by line.

### 1️⃣ Navigation landmark

```html
<nav role="navigation" aria-label="Main Navigation">
```

✔ Screen readers understand:  
👉 “This is the main navigation area”

✔ `aria-label` gives a **clear name** to the navigation

✅ Very good practice

---

### 2️⃣ Menu items

```html
<a href="#" role="menuitem">Home</a>
```

✔ Screen readers announce these as menu items  
✔ Helps users understand structure

⚠️ **Small note**: If you are using normal links, `role="menuitem"` is optional. Native HTML already does a good job.

### 3️⃣ Keyboard focusable heading

```html
<h1 tabindex="0">Welcome</h1>
```

✔ Keyboard users can focus on the heading  
✔ Screen readers can land here easily

✅ Useful when the heading is important

---

### 4️⃣ Accessible button label

```html
<button aria-label="Click for more info">More Info</button>
```

✔ Screen reader announces:  
👉 “Click for more info, button”

✅ Very clear and helpful

## 🧠 What a Screen Reader User Experiences

When navigating your page, they hear something like:

> Navigation, Main Navigation  
> List with 2 items  
> Home, menu item  
> About, menu item  
> Main content  
> Welcome, heading  
> Click for more info, button

That’s **excellent clarity** 👍

## 🏆 Interview Tip (Very Useful)

If asked _“What is web accessibility?”_, say:

> “Web accessibility ensures that websites are usable by everyone, including people using screen readers, keyboard navigation, and assistive technologies. I follow semantic HTML first, then ARIA only when needed.”

That answer sounds **very professional**.
