Nice 👍  
This is a **clean and very common content-filtering example**.  
Below is **simple, exam-friendly pseudocode** that explains exactly how this works.

---

# **Pseudocode: Content Filtering (Search Filter)**

---

## **START**

---

## **INITIAL SETUP**

```
DISPLAY a search input box
DISPLAY a list of items
```

---

## **PROCEDURE filterItems()**

```
READ text entered in search box
CONVERT search text to lowercase

GET all list items

FOR each item in the list
    GET item text
    CONVERT item text to lowercase

    IF item text contains search text
        SHOW the item
    ELSE
        HIDE the item
    END IF
END FOR
```

---

## **USER INTERACTION**

```
WHEN user types in the search box
    CALL filterItems()
```

---

## **END**

---

## 🧠 Easy Explanation

• User types something in search box  
• Each list item is checked  
• Matching items stay visible  
• Non-matching items are hidden

This filtering happens **instantly** while typing.

## 🚀 Smart Improvements You Can Try Next

To make it more professional:

- Add **highlight matched text**
    
- Show **“No results found”**
    
- Debounce input (performance)
    
- Filter using **API data**
    
- Make it **case-insensitive + accent-insensitive**
    

If you want, I can:

- Implement advanced version
    
- Draw a **flowchart**
    
- Convert into **React search filter**
    
- Add **accessibility improvements**
