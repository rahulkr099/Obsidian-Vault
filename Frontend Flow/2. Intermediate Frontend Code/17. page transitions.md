Nice project 👍  
This is a clean example of **smooth page transitions**, so let’s break it into **simple pseudocode** for **all files** in an easy, student-friendly way.

I’ll explain **what the code is thinking**, not the exact syntax. This helps you remember and rewrite it anytime.

---

## 1️⃣ HTML File – Structure & Navigation (index.html)

**Goal:**  
Create sections (pages) and links to switch between them.

### Pseudocode – HTML

```
START HTML document

SET language to English
SET page title

LINK external CSS file

START body

    CREATE navigation bar
        CREATE list of links
            EACH link:
                - has text (Home, About, Services, Contact)
                - stores which section it should open (data-target)

    CREATE main container

        CREATE section "Home"
            MARK this section as active by default
            ADD heading and text

        CREATE section "About"
            ADD heading and text

        CREATE section "Services"
            ADD heading and text

        CREATE section "Contact"
            ADD heading and text

    LOAD JavaScript file

END body
END HTML document
```

💡 **Why this works**

- Only one section is active at a time
    
- `data-target` helps JavaScript know **which page to show**

## 2️⃣ CSS File – Layout & Animation (styles.css)

**Goal:**  
Hide pages, then slide the active one smoothly into view.

### Pseudocode – CSS

```
STYLE body
    SET font
    REMOVE default margin and padding
    SET background color

STYLE navigation bar
    SET dark background
    CENTER the menu items

STYLE navigation links
    SET text color to white
    REMOVE underline
    ADD hover color animation

STYLE container
    MAKE position relative
    SET height to full screen
    HIDE overflow (important for slide effect)

STYLE each page section
    POSITION absolutely
    PLACE page outside screen on the right
    SET full width and height
    CENTER content vertically and horizontally
    SET transition animation for movement
    SET opacity to invisible

STYLE active page
    MOVE page into visible screen
    SET opacity to visible
```

✨ **Key idea**

- Pages are **stacked**
    
- Only the `.active` page is visible
    
- Animation comes from changing `left` position smoothly

## 3️⃣ JavaScript File – Page Switching Logic (script.js)

**Goal:**  
When user clicks a link → hide current page → show target page.

### Pseudocode – JavaScript

```
GET all navigation links
GET all page sections

FOR each navigation link
    ADD click event listener

    WHEN link is clicked
        PREVENT page reload

        GET target section name from clicked link

        FOR each page
            REMOVE "active" class

        FIND the page that matches target name
        ADD "active" class to that page
```

🚀 **What’s happening**

- JavaScript does **not reload** the page
    
- It only switches CSS classes
    
- CSS handles the animation automatically

## 4️⃣ Overall Flow – Big Picture

```
User clicks menu link
        ↓
JavaScript detects click
        ↓
JavaScript removes active page
        ↓
JavaScript activates new page
        ↓
CSS animates page sliding
```

That’s it. Simple and powerful ✨

## 🌱 Ideas to Improve This Project (Next Level)

Here are some upgrades you can try:

1. **Add fade + slide together**  
    → Animate `opacity` and `transform`
    
2. **Keyboard navigation**  
    → Use arrow keys to switch pages
    
3. **URL hash support**  
    → `/about`, `/services` without reload
    
4. **Reusable component idea**  
    → Turn this into a small JS library
    
5. **Mobile swipe gestures**  
    → Swipe left/right to change pages

If you want, next we can:

- Convert this into **React**
    
- Add **GSAP animations**
    
- Or write **real interview-style explanation**
