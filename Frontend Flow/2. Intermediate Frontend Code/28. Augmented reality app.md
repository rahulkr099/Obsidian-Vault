Sure 👍  
Here is **ONLY simple, clean pseudocode** for the **Augmented Reality Web App (WebXR) project**.

---

## 📄 1️⃣ HTML (index.html) – Pseudocode

```
START HTML document

SET language to English
SET character encoding
SET responsive viewport
SET page title

LOAD Three.js library
LOAD WebXR polyfill
LOAD ARButton helper

DEFINE basic styles
    REMOVE margins
    HIDE scrollbars
    MAKE canvas full screen

START body

    LOAD main JavaScript file

END body
END HTML document
```

---

## 🧠 2️⃣ JavaScript (script.js) – Pseudocode

```
CREATE 3D scene

CREATE camera
    SET perspective camera
    POSITION camera for AR view

CREATE renderer
    ENABLE WebXR support
    SET renderer size to screen
    ADD renderer canvas to page

ADD AR button to page
    ALLOW user to start AR session

CREATE light source
    ADD light to scene

CREATE cube geometry
CREATE material with red color
CREATE cube mesh
ADD cube to scene

DEFINE animation loop
    ROTATE cube slightly
    RENDER scene using camera
    REQUEST next animation frame

START animation loop using WebXR
```

---

## 🔁 3️⃣ Overall Logic – Pseudocode

```
User opens page on AR-supported device
    ↓
User taps AR button
    ↓
Camera view opens
    ↓
3D cube appears in real world
    ↓
Cube rotates continuously
```

### 🌱 Improvement ideas

- Add tap interaction to place object
    
- Add multiple 3D objects
    
- Use real-world surface detection
    
- Add scale and rotate gestures
