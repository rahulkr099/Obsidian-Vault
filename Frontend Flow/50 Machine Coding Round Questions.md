# ⚡ Want me to create ALL 50 projects for you one by one?

I can generate:

- ✔ Full HTML + CSS + JS
    
- ✔ Clean interview code
    
- ✔ Explanations for interviewer
    
- ✔ Extra improvements
    
- ✔ Folder structure
    

Just tell me:  
**“Create all 50”** or  
**“Create the next one: ”**

I’m ready!

Great question, Rahul — and this is where I’ll give you the **real truth**, not hype.

---

# ✅ **Do companies ask all 50 of these to a fresher?**

**NO.**  
Nobody will ask you _all_ these 50 problems.

But…

### 🔥 **These 50 problems represent the “question bank” companies pick from.**

Different companies ask **different subsets** of these.

As a fresher:

### ✔ You will typically get **1 machine coding round**

and

### ✔ They will usually choose **1 or 2 problems** from this list.

The goal is not to master all 50…  
but to **cover enough patterns** so you can handle _any variation_ they throw at you.

---

# 🧩 **So how many will they actually expect?**

### 🎯 **For a fresher / SDE-1 Frontend role:**

You should comfortably know **10–15 core problems** out of the list.

Here are exactly the ones companies MOST commonly ask freshers:

# ⭐ **Top 15 Machine Coding Problems for Freshers (Most Asked)**

### UI / Components

1. Tabs
    
2. Accordion
    
3. Modal
    
4. Dropdown
    
5. Pagination
    
6. Search with Debounce
    
7. Carousel / Slider
    

### Logic-Based

8. Like / Upvote Counter
    
9. Timer
    
10. Stopwatch
    
11. Todo List
    
12. Shopping Cart (simple version)
    

### Forms

13. Form validation
    
14. OTP input boxes
    

### Data

15. Fetch & render list (users/products)
    

This is the **core syllabus** for freshers.

# 📌 **Then why did I give you 50 problems?**

Because:

- Different companies ask different questions
    
- Some ask easy UI components
    
- Some ask API + search
    
- Some test business logic (cart, wishlist)
    
- Some test timers or debouncing
    
- Some ask tricky toggle logic
    

If you practice **only 15 problems**, you can easily solve those 15.

But if companies twist the question (e.g., “Tabs + Modal inside it”), you might be stuck.

If you practice **50 patterns**, then:

💥 You can solve ANY variation confidently  
💥 You appear much stronger than other freshers  
💥 Your logical thinking improves massively  
💥 You crack more rounds, more companies, more chances

---

# 🎯 **Final Truth**

Companies don’t expect a fresher to know all 50.  
But if _you_ know them, you become:

- The top 5% of candidates
    
- Interview-proof
    
- Confident in any machine coding round
    
- More likely to get selected
    

You're basically future-proofing yourself.

# 🚀 Want a prioritized, 15-project-only plan?

If you say **“Yes, give me the top 15 training plan”**,  
I’ll give you a **7-day** practice schedule that covers only the **exact** problems freshers get asked the most.

Just tell me.
