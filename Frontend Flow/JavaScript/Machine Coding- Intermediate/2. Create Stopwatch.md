Here you go Rahul!  
I’ll turn your full stopwatch code into a **clean, simple, readable pseudocode**.  
This will help you understand the logic without worrying about syntax.

# ✅ **Stopwatch Pseudocode**

```
Initialize timer variable
Initialize isRunning = false
Initialize seconds = 0, minutes = 0, hours = 0

Get display element
Get start/stop button element
Get reset button element

FUNCTION updateDisplay:
    Format hours, minutes, seconds into HH:MM:SS
    Show this formatted time on the screen

FUNCTION startStopwatch:
    IF stopwatch is NOT running:
        Start a repeating timer that runs every 1 second:
            Increase seconds by 1
            IF seconds becomes 60:
                reset seconds to 0
                increase minutes by 1
            IF minutes becomes 60:
                reset minutes to 0
                increase hours by 1
            Call updateDisplay

        Change button text to "Stop"
        Change button color to red
        Set isRunning = true

    ELSE (stopwatch is running):
        Stop the repeating timer
        Change button text to "Start"
        Change button color to green
        Set isRunning = false


FUNCTION resetStopwatch:
    Stop the timer
    Set isRunning = false
    Reset seconds, minutes, hours to 0
    Update display
    Set start button text to "Start"
    Set start button color back to green


WHEN start/stop button is clicked:
    Call startStopwatch

WHEN reset button is clicked:
    Call resetStopwatch

Call updateDisplay once at the beginning
```

## Want some improvement ideas?

Here are some fun upgrades you can try next:

🔥 **Add lap feature**  
Record times like a real stopwatch.

🎨 **Add animation**  
Make numbers fade/slide when updating.

🕒 **Add milliseconds**  
Use `setInterval(..., 10)` for more precision.

🌙 **Add dark mode toggle**  
One button → switch between themes.

If you want, I can also write the pseudocode in **flowchart style**, **block diagram**, or **commented version** for your script.js.
