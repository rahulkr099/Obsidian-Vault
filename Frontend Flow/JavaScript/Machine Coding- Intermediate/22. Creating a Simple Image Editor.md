Here you go Rahul!  
Here’s a **very clear, simple, and beginner-friendly pseudocode** for your entire **Simple Image Editor** project.  
This covers image upload → drawing → filters → rotation → reset → download.

# ✅ **Simple Image Editor – Pseudocode**

```
Get image input field
Get canvas and its drawing context
Create an Image object (img)
Create variable to store original image data

WHEN user selects an image:
    Read the selected file
    Convert file to a DataURL
    Set img.src to the DataURL (this loads the image)

WHEN image finishes loading:
    Resize canvas to half the image width and height
    Draw the image on the canvas
    Save the drawn image's pixel data as originalImageData

FUNCTION applyFilter(filter):
    Apply CSS filter (blur, brightness, contrast, etc.) to canvas

FUNCTION rotateImage:
    Create a temporary canvas
    Swap width and height for rotation

    Move drawing origin to center of new canvas
    Rotate by 90 degrees
    Draw original canvas onto temporary canvas after rotation

    Update main canvas size to rotated size
    Draw rotated result back to main canvas

FUNCTION resetImage:
    Replace current canvas content with originalImageData
    Remove any applied CSS filters

FUNCTION downloadImage:
    Create an invisible download link
    Convert canvas to a PNG image URL
    Auto-click link to download the edited image
```
