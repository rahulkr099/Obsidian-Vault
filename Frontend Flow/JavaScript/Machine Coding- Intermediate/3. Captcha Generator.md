Sure Rahul!  
Here is the **clean and simple pseudocode** for your CAPTCHA program. I’ll keep it super easy to understand and also give small improvement ideas at the end.

# ✅ **CAPTCHA Generator – Pseudocode**

```
Get captcha display element
Get refresh button
Get user input box
Get submit button
Get result message element

FUNCTION generateCaptcha:
    Set a string of all allowed characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9)
    Create an empty string called captcha
    REPEAT 6 times:
        Pick a random character from the string
        Add that character to captcha
    Show captcha text in the captcha display area

WHEN submit button is clicked:
    IF user input matches the shown captcha:
        Show message "Captcha Verified!"
        Add success styling
    ELSE:
        Show message "Incorrect Captcha. Try Again!"
        Add error styling

WHEN refresh button is clicked:
    Call generateCaptcha

Call generateCaptcha once at the beginning to show the first captcha
```

## 🚀 Cool improvement ideas

You can level it up with these simple upgrades:

⭐ **Add random colors or fonts** — makes captcha harder to read by bots  
⭐ **Add distortion or rotation** — even more secure  
⭐ **Add timer-based captcha refresh** — updates every 30 sec  
⭐ **Add keyboard Enter key support** — smoother UX

If you want, I can also create **flowchart-style pseudocode**, or rewrite it in a more **DSA-like structure** to boost your logic thinking.
