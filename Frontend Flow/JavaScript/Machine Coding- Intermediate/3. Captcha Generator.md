Sure Rahul!  
Here is the **clean and simple pseudocode** for your CAPTCHA program. I’ll keep it super easy to understand and also give small improvement ideas at the end.

# ✅ **CAPTCHA Generator – Pseudocode**

```
Get captcha display element
Get refresh button
Get user input box
Get submit button
Get result message element

FUNCTION generateCaptcha:
    Set a string of all allowed characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9)
    Create an empty string called captcha
    REPEAT 6 times:
        Pick a random character from the string
        Add that character to captcha
    Show captcha text in the captcha display area

WHEN submit button is clicked:
    IF user input matches the shown captcha:
        Show message "Captcha Verified!"
        Add success styling
    ELSE:
        Show message "Incorrect Captcha. Try Again!"
        Add error styling

WHEN refresh button is clicked:
    Call generateCaptcha

Call generateCaptcha once at the beginning to show the first captcha
```
