# ✅ **Quiz App – Pseudocode**

```
Define quizData (array of questions, options, and correct answers)

Set currentQuestion = 0
Set score = 0

Get all required DOM elements:
    question text
    options container
    next button
    quiz screen box
    result screen box
    score display
    restart button

FUNCTION loadQuestion:
    Get current question from quizData
    Display the question text
    Clear old options

    FOR each option in current question:
        Create a button
        Set button text = option
        When button is clicked → call checkAnswer(option)
        Add button to options container

    Hide the next button

FUNCTION checkAnswer(selectedOption):
    Get the correct answer of current question

    IF selectedOption equals correct answer:
        Increase score by 1

    Disable all option buttons
    FOR each option button:
        IF button text matches correct answer:
            color it green
        ELSE:
            color it red

    Show the next button

WHEN next button clicked:
    Increase currentQuestion by 1
    IF there are more questions:
        Call loadQuestion
    ELSE:
        Call showResult

FUNCTION showResult:
    Hide quiz box
    Show result box
    Display "You scored X out of total"

WHEN restart button clicked:
    Reset currentQuestion = 0
    Reset score = 0
    Hide result box
    Show quiz box
    Call loadQuestion

At start:
    Call loadQuestion
```
