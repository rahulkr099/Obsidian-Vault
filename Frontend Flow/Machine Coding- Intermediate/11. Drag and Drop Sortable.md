Here you go Rahul!  
Here’s a **clear, simple, beginner-friendly pseudocode** for your Drag-and-Drop Sortable List.  
This explains the whole logic step-by-step so you understand how sorting works with mouse dragging.

# ✅ **Drag & Drop Sortable List – Pseudocode**

```
Get the sortable list element
Create a variable draggedItem = null

WHEN a list item starts dragging:
    Set draggedItem = the item being dragged
    Add CSS class "dragging" to highlight it

WHEN dragging ends:
    Remove the "dragging" class
    Set draggedItem = null

WHEN dragging over the list:
    Prevent default so drop is allowed
    Find which item the dragged item should be placed before
        (use getDragAfterElement)

    IF there is no item after the cursor:
        Append the dragged item to the end of the list
    ELSE:
        Insert the dragged item before the found element

FUNCTION getDragAfterElement(container, mouseY):
    Get all list items that are NOT being dragged

    For each item:
        Get the item's box position (top and height)
        Calculate offset = mouseY - box.top - (box.height / 2)
        If offset is negative AND closer than previous closest:
            Update closest item and offset

    Return the element with the closest negative offset
```
