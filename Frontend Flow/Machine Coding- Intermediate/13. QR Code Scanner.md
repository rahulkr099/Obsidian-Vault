Here you go Rahul!  
Here’s a **clean, simple, and very easy-to-understand pseudocode** for your QR Code Scanner logic.  
This explains exactly how the scanning starts, detects a QR code, and stops.

# ✅ **QR Code Scanner – Pseudocode**

```
When the page finishes loading:
    Create a new QR scanner object linked to the "qr-reader" area
    Get the result display element

    FUNCTION onScanSuccess(scannedText):
        Show the scanned text on the screen
        Stop the QR scanner

    FUNCTION onScanError(errorMessage):
        Print the error message to the console (optional)

    Start the QR scanner with:
        - Camera set to rear camera (environment)
        - Frame rate = 10 fps
        - QR scanning box size = 250x250
        - Success callback = onScanSuccess
        - Error callback = onScanError
```

## 🚀 Want some cool upgrade ideas?

Here are some fun improvements to make your scanner more advanced:

✨ Add a button to restart scanning  
✨ Add beep sound when QR is detected  
✨ Show the camera preview in a rounded window  
✨ Add history list of scanned QR codes  
✨ Automatically open the link if QR contains a URL  
✨ Display loading animation while the camera boots

If you want, I can also help you make a **custom UI QR scanner** or give you a **React version** for practice!
