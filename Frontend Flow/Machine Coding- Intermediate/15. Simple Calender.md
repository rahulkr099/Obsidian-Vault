Here’s a **clean, beginner-friendly, easy-to-understand pseudocode** for your Calendar App.  
This explains exactly how the calendar renders, updates months, and highlights today.

# ✅ **Calendar App – Pseudocode**

```
When the webpage loads:
    Get month-year display element
    Get calendar grid container
    Get previous and next month buttons
    Set currentDate = today's date

FUNCTION renderCalendar(date):
    Clear the calendar grid

    Extract year from date
    Extract month from date

    Show month and year in readable format (e.g., “October 2024”)

    Find which weekday the first day of the month starts on
    Find total number of days in the month

    FOR each empty day before the first actual date:
        Add an empty calendar cell

    FOR each day from 1 to totalDays:
        Create a day cell
        Write the number inside it

        IF this day is today AND month/year match today's month/year:
            Add the “current-day” highlight class

        Add the day cell to the calendar grid

WHEN prev month button clicked:
    Move currentDate to previous month
    Call renderCalendar with updated date

WHEN next month button clicked:
    Move currentDate to next month
    Call renderCalendar with updated date

At start:
    Call renderCalendar to show the current month
```
