Absolutely Rahul!  
Here is a **very clean, easy, beginner-friendly pseudocode** for your full Snake Game.  
This explains the entire logic step-by-step so you can understand how the game works internally.

# ✅ **Snake Game – Pseudocode**

```
Set canvas size based on box size (20×20 grid)
Initialize snake with one segment at center
Generate random food position inside grid
Set initial movement direction = RIGHT
Set score = 0

WHEN a key is pressed:
    If LEFT arrow and current direction is NOT RIGHT → set direction to LEFT
    If UP arrow and current direction is NOT DOWN → set direction to UP
    If RIGHT arrow and current direction is NOT LEFT → set direction to RIGHT
    If DOWN arrow and current direction is NOT UP → set direction to DOWN

FUNCTION draw:
    Clear the entire canvas

    Draw the food in red

    For each segment of the snake:
        If it is the head → draw it lime
        Else → draw it green

    Get current head position (headX, headY)

    Move head position:
        If direction = LEFT → headX -= box
        If direction = UP → headY -= box
        If direction = RIGHT → headX += box
        If direction = DOWN → headY += box

    IF head touches food:
        Increase score
        Update on-screen score
        Generate new random food position
        (Don't remove snake tail → snake grows)

    ELSE:
        Remove last segment of snake (snake moves normally)

    Create new head with updated coordinates

    CHECK game over conditions:
        IF head goes outside canvas boundary → Game Over
        IF head touches any part of itself → Game Over

    If Game Over:
        Show alert "Game Over!"
        Reload page to restart

    Insert new head at the beginning of snake array (snake moves)

Repeat draw function every 100 milliseconds
```
