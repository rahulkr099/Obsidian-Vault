Here’s a **clean, clear, easy-to-understand pseudocode** for your entire **Quiz App with Timer**.  
I’ve kept everything super simple and step-by-step so the logic becomes crystal clear.

# ✅ **Quiz App with Timer – Pseudocode**

```
Define list of questions (each has: question, options, answer)

Set currentQuestionIndex = 0
Set score = 0
Set timeLimit = 10 seconds
Set timeLeft = timeLimit
Create timer variable

Get all required UI elements:
    question box, question text, options list,
    next button, timer display, result display

FUNCTION startQuiz:
    Call showQuestion

FUNCTION showQuestion:
    Stop any old timer
    Reset timeLeft to timeLimit
    Update timer display

    Get current question based on currentQuestionIndex
    Display question text
    Clear old options

    FOR each option:
        Create a button
        Set button text
        When clicked → call checkAnswer(option)
        Add button to options list

    Start timer that runs every 1 second:
        Decrease timeLeft
        Update timer display
        IF timeLeft reaches 0:
            Stop timer
            Call nextQuestion

FUNCTION checkAnswer(selectedAnswer):
    Stop timer
    Get correct answer for current question

    For each option button:
        If button text = correct answer → highlight green
        Else if button text = selectedAnswer → highlight red
        Disable button

    If selectedAnswer = correct answer:
        Increase score

    Show the Next button

FUNCTION nextQuestion:
    Increase currentQuestionIndex
    IF there are more questions:
        Hide Next button
        Show next question
    ELSE:
        Show results

FUNCTION showResult:
    Hide question container
    Display "Quiz Completed! Your score: X / total"
    Hide Next button

When nextButton is clicked:
    Call nextQuestion

At start:
    Call startQuiz
```

## 🚀 Want to upgrade your timed quiz?

Here are some cool ideas you can add:

✨ Add progress bar with time animation  
✨ Add negative marking for wrong answers  
✨ Add sound effects for correct/wrong  
✨ Add leaderboard using localStorage  
✨ Add animated transitions between questions  
✨ Add lifelines (50-50, skip, pause timer)

If you'd like, I can also give you **flowchart-style pseudocode**, or help you build a **full MERN quiz system** with a database and analytics.
