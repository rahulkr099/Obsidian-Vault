Here you go Rahul!  
I’ve written **clean, simple, step-by-step pseudocode** for your entire To-Do List app, including localStorage logic.  
This will help you understand the full workflow from adding → completing → deleting → saving tasks.

# ✅ **To-Do List App – Pseudocode**

```
1.When page loads:
    Call loadTasks to show saved tasks

3.FUNCTION addTask:
    Read user input from taskInput
    Remove extra spaces from input
    IF input is empty:
        Stop function

    Create a new <li> element
    Inside it add:
        - A <span> showing task text, clickable to toggle complete
        - A delete button to remove task

    Add the <li> to the task list
    Call saveTasks to update localStorage
    Clear the input box

4.FUNCTION toggleComplete(taskSpan):
    Toggle the CSS class "completed" on the clicked task
    Call saveTasks

5.FUNCTION deleteTask(deleteButton):
    Remove the parent <li> from the list
    Call saveTasks

6.FUNCTION saveTasks:
    Create an empty array "tasks"
    
    For each <li> in the task list:
        Extract text of the task (remove the delete button text “X”)
        Check if the task has the "completed" class
        Save both values (text + completed state) into the array

    Convert the array into JSON string
    Store it in localStorage with key "tasks"

2.FUNCTION loadTasks:
    Read stored task data from localStorage
    IF nothing is found:
        Use an empty array

    For each saved task:
        Create a new <li> element
        Add task text inside <span>
        If the task was marked completed:
            Add “completed” class to the span

        Add delete button
        Add <li> to the task list
```

## 🚀 Fresh improvement ideas for your To-Do App

You can take it to the next level with small tweaks:

✨ Add edit feature (double-click a task to edit)  
✨ Add categories (work, personal, urgent)  
✨ Add drag-and-drop sorting  
✨ Add due dates + reminders  
✨ Add a “Clear completed tasks” button  
✨ Add task filters (All / Completed / Pending)

If you want, I can even help you build a **DSA-style version** (linked list–based todo), or convert this into a **React version** for practice.
