Here’s a **clean, simple, easy-to-understand pseudocode** for your Tic-Tac-Toe game.  
This breaks the entire logic into clear steps so you understand the full flow.

# ✅ **Tic-Tac-Toe Game – Pseudocode**

```
Initialize board as an array of 9 empty strings
Set currentPlayer = "X"
Set gameActive = true

1.FUNCTION makeMove(index):
    IF selected cell is empty AND gameActive is true:
        Place currentPlayer symbol on board[index]
        Update UI cell at that index

        IF checkWinner returns true:
            Show message "Player X/O Wins!"
            Set gameActive = false
            STOP the function

        IF all cells in board are filled:
            Show "It's a Draw!"
            Set gameActive = false
            STOP the function

        Switch currentPlayer:
            If X → O
            If O → X

        Update status message to show whose turn it is

2.FUNCTION checkWinner:
    Define winPatterns as:
        - 3 rows
        - 3 columns
        - 2 diagonals

    FOR each pattern (a, b, c):
        IF board[a] is not empty AND
           board[a] == board[b] AND board[b] == board[c]:
            RETURN true

    RETURN false   (no winner)

3.FUNCTION resetGame:
    Reset board to 9 empty cells
    Set gameActive = true
    Set currentPlayer = "X"
    Update status: "Player X's Turn"
    Clear UI text for all cells
```
