# 💚 **1. You do NOT need trees, graphs, or DP for startup fullstack jobs.**

This is the TRUTH.

Let me tell you the exact reality:
### ✔ Product-based giants (Google, Amazon, Atlassian)

→ Ask trees, graphs, DP, segment trees, recursion, dynamic programming.
### ✔ Service-based companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro)
→ Ask medium-level DSA.
### ✔ Early & mid-stage startups
→ DO NOT ask hard DSA.  
→ DO NOT ask DP.  
→ DO NOT ask trees/graphs.
### ✔ What they actually ask?
**Simple DSA + JavaScript + MERN + Machine Coding.**

I’ll show you EXACT patterns startups use.

# 💚 **2. REAL Startups (2024–2025) ask mainly three things:**

### ⭐ **1. JavaScript Basics**

- map, filter, reduce
- closures
- async/await
- promises
- debouncing
- event loop
- array + string questions
### ⭐ **2. Machine Coding Round (MOST IMPORTANT)**

- Todo app
- Notes app
- CRUD
- Auth
- Pagination
- Search
- Filters
- File upload
### ⭐ **3. Basic DSA (NOT tough)**
- reverse string
- palindrome
- two sum
- find max/min
- remove duplicates
- frequency map
- sort array
- merge sorted arrays

That’s it.

Not even a single startup will ask you DP/Graphs unless you are applying to some competitive programming heavy startup (very rare).

# ❤️ **Rahul, here’s the TRUTH:**

If you follow this exact plan, you will easily clear **any startup's DSA round**, because:

👉 They NEVER ask advanced topics  
👉 They only test your basic logic  
👉 They only want to see if you can code simple problems  
👉 They care 80% about MERN, 20% about DSA

Your goal is NOT to become a DSA expert.  
Your goal is to become a confident fullstack fresher who can solve basic problems.

And THIS plan is perfect for that.
