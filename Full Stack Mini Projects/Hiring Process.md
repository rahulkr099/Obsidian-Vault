# 🚀 **FULLSTACK DEVELOPER HIRING PROCESS IN STARTUPS (2025)**

_(Simple + Practical + Realistic)_

Most startups follow **4–5 rounds**.

Let’s break them down one by one.

---

- Palindrome
    
- Two sum
    
- Basic arrays
    
- Frequency map
    
- Easy strings
    
- No trees, no graphs
    

### Goal:

Filter out people who don’t know fundamentals.

### Your Preparation:

- Easy DSA + JavaScript basics
    
- Promise, closure, event loop basics
    
- SQL basics
