# ✅ **ROUND 1 — What They REALLY Test**

Startups don’t care about deep DSA.  
They test only:

### ✔ Does the candidate know basic programming?

### ✔ Can they solve easy problems?

### ✔ Does he know JS fundamentals?

### ✔ Does he know basic SQL / API concepts?

### ✔ Does he understand promises/closures?

This round is **just a filter**, not a big challenge.

# 🎯 **YOUR CLEARING STRATEGY (Step-by-step)**

## **STEP 1 — Master Easy DSA (Only These Topics)**

Good news — you don’t need LeetCode Medium/Hard.

### You only need:

- Arrays
    
- Strings
    
- Hashmaps
    
- Two pointers
    
- Basic math
    
- Basic stack problems (optional)
    

### TOP 15 PROBLEMS YOU SHOULD MASTER

If you master these 15, you clear ANY startup screening.

1. Reverse string
    
2. Palindrome check
    
3. Two sum
    
4. Find max element
    
5. Remove duplicates from array
    
6. Frequency map of characters
    
7. Count vowels
    
8. Merge two arrays
    
9. Move zeros to end
    
10. FizzBuzz
    
11. Find second largest
    
12. Check anagram
    
13. Longest word in a sentence
    
14. Print unique elements
    
15. Find intersection of arrays
    

🔥 Do these **in JavaScript**, because that’s your main stack.

# ⭐ **STEP 2 — Master JavaScript Basics**

### Must-know concepts:

- let vs var vs const
    
- Hoisting
    
- Closures
    
- Promise basics
    
- async/await
    
- Event loop
    
- setTimeout order
    
- Spread/rest operator
    
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, find)
    
- Template literals
    
- Arrow functions
    
- Nullish coalescing (??)
    
- Optional chaining (?.)
    

### MOST COMMON MCQ TOPICS

- Output of code: closures
    
- Output of code: promises
    
- Output of code: event loop
    
- Output of code: hoisting
    
- Map/filter/reduce output questions
    

I can also give you 100 most common MCQs if you want.

# 🔥 **STEP 3 — Basic SQL Prep**

Startups ask VERY simple SQL questions.

### Must know:

- SELECT
    
- WHERE
    
- ORDER BY
    
- LIMIT
    
- COUNT
    
- Aggregates (MIN, MAX, AVG)
    
- Simple JOIN (only 1 level)
    

### Example Questions:

- Get top 5 highest salaries
    
- Count number of users
    
- Get all active users
    
- Order products by price
    
- Find average rating
    

No complex joins. No subqueries.

---

# 🧠 **STEP 4 — Basic OOPS Prep**

Just know 4 principles:

- Encapsulation
    
- Abstraction
    
- Inheritance
    
- Polymorphism
    

In JavaScript context:

- class
    
- constructor
    
- extends
    
- super
    
- method overriding
    

They ask **concept**, not code.

---

# 📚 **STEP 5 — Basic Web / API Knowledge**

Startups often ask:

- What is REST API?
    
- What is status code 200/201/400/404/500?
    
- What is JSON?
    
- What is CORS?
    
- What is GET/POST/PUT/DELETE?
    
- What is authentication?
    
- What is authorization?
    
- What is middleware?
    

This is easy for you because you already know MERN.

---

# 🏆 **WHAT INTERVIEWER WANTS TO SEE IN ROUND 1**

### ✔ You understand basics

### ✔ You write clean JS code

### ✔ You solve easy questions

### ✔ You know how promises/closures work

### ✔ You know fundamental SQL

### ✔ You don’t freeze under pressure

NOT:

❌ Hard DSA  
❌ Graphs/DP/Heaps  
❌ Complex SQL joins  
❌ LeetCode medium

This is NOT required for MERN fullstack startup roles.

---

# ⚠️ **Mistakes that make people fail Round 1**

❌ Trying to do LeetCode Hard  
❌ Not knowing JS fundamentals  
❌ Panic when output-based questions appear  
❌ No SQL knowledge  
❌ Slow coding  
❌ Too much theory, no practice

We will avoid all of these.

# ✨ **Rahul, want me to create a FULL ROUND 1 MOCK TEST for you?**

I can create:

### 📝 **Round 1 Mock Test**

- 15 JS MCQs
    
- 10 SQL questions
    
- 5 DSA problems
    
- 5 output questions
    
- 5 theory questions on API/HTTP
    

If you want, say ✔ **YES, create mock test**.

I’ll make a full practice test exactly like real startup interviews.
