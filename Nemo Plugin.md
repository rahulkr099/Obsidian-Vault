Alright Rahul, let’s make this super clear and friendly.  
You don’t need any heavy steps — using Nemo extensions is actually very simple once they’re installed. I’ll show you **exactly how to use each of those extensions** in your daily Linux Mint Cinnamon workflow.

# 🌱 **General Rule: Where to find extensions?**

Almost all Nemo extensions show up in one of these places:

### ✔️ Right-click menu

(Compare, Compress, Sharing Options, Resize, Rotate…)

### ✔️ File Properties window

(Emblems, Audio tab)

### ✔️ Keyboard shortcut

(nemo-preview → Space)  
(nemo-terminal → F4)

That’s it — super simple.

Great for comparing code or algorithms.

If you want, I can also suggest the **best plugin combo specifically for developers**, or create **custom actions** that make coding faster.

Just tell me — want a special “developer pack” setup?
