Rahul, this is awesome!
You’re moving into the **terminal-first lifestyle** → and honestly, it will make you 10× faster as a developer.
Let’s set you up properly and give you a **clean, powerful workflow** using the tools you listed.
I’ll guide you like a friend sitting next to you. ❤️
Simple words, clear steps, and lots of little tips to help you build a smooth terminal habit.
# 🚀 1) Your Terminal Should Feel Like HOME
Before learning commands, first build a terminal that you _love_ opening.
## **Install Zsh + oh-my-zsh**
Logout → login.
Now install Oh My Zsh:
This is <span style="color:red">red text</span>.
## **Enable Beautiful Prompt + Plugins**
Use the theme **powerlevel10k** (fast + clean):
Then update your `.zshrc`:
Restart terminal → you'll get a setup wizard.
Your terminal will instantly look premium. ⭐
# 🧲 2) Install All Your Cool Tools
Run these together:
### **Install LazyGit**
### **Install yazi (file manager)**
Then add to PATH if needed:
# 🦄 3) Make Your Terminal FEEL Powerful (Aliases)
Add these to the bottom of your `~/.zshrc`:
Reload:
# 🎨 4) Use Vim or Neovim INSIDE VS Code Terminal
### Install Neovim
Open VS Code → press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → type:
Choose **Zsh**.
Now VS Code terminal = your real system terminal.
Try:
It opens a full project browser inside Neovim.
# 🧭 5) Yazi → Your Terminal File Explorer
This is soooo smooth.
To open:
Shortcuts you should remember:
* `j` / `k` → down/up
* `h` / `l` → back/enter folder
* `q` → quit
* `yy` → copy
* `dd` → delete
* `p` → paste
Feels like Vim but for files.
# 🎯 6) LazyGit = Git but on steroids
Open inside a project:
Then:
* `A` → stage all
* `c` → commit
* `p` → push
* `f` → pull
It removes 90% of Git stress.
# 🔍 7) Ripgrep + Bat Combo (Search Smarter)
Find text in files:
Show code with line numbers + syntax:
Search + highlight:
Beautiful 🔥
# 📘 8) Learn Commands Faster with tldr
Instead of reading boring man pages:
Simple examples → fast learning.
# 🧩 9) Build Daily Terminal Habits
Here are small tasks to practice every day:
### Day 1 → Move around folders
### Day 2 → View + search files
### Day 3 → Edit using nvim
### Day 4 → Git workflow
### Day 5 → File operations using yazi
Open → rename → delete → move.
### Day 6 → System monitoring
### Day 7 → Customize more alias & shortcuts
Make it more “you”.
# 💡 Future Improvements (innovative ideas)
* Add **fzf** → fuzzy search for EVERYTHING (superpower).
* Add **zoxide** → smarter `cd` (jump to folders instantly).
* Add **starship** → stylish prompt alternative.
* Automate setup with a `.dotfiles` repo on GitHub.
* Add keyboard shortcuts for frequent commands.
If you want, I can build a **complete terminal learning roadmap (30 days)** or a **perfect .zshrc template** for you.
Just say _“make it for me”_ and I’ll prepare it.
